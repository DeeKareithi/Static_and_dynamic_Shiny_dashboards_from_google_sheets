```{r get-data, message=FALSE, include=FALSE}
# Create a function that reads the data from Google. I've seen other examples
# that make this a reactive(), but I don't really know what that is since I
# rarely use Shiny :shrug:
#
# I'm also not completely sold that this is the right approach, since this feels
# kind of roundabout (create a function, run the function), but it doesn't work
# if you just do remote_data <- read_sheet(). Also :shrug: for now.
#
# ALSO flexdashboard can use a special global chunk to speed up expensive data
# loading (https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/shiny.html#loading_data),
# which I assume also includes loading data remotely from Google, but if you
# name this chunk global, the dynamic data loading stops working. Once again,
# big :shrug:.

read_sheet("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pEsf3ULhCdGM5q_vDSgcLiqPPy1qqEEF2YPVFgGGCVc/edit?usp=sharing")}

```

## Row

### Categories {.value-box}

```{r}
n_categories <- remote_data %>% distinct(Category) %>% nrow()

# Put valueBox() inside renderValueBox({})
renderValueBox({
  valueBox(value = n_categories, icon = "fas fa-users")
})
```


### Total {.value-box}

```{r}
total <- sum(remote_data$Count)

# Put valueBox() inside renderValueBox({})
renderValueBox({
  valueBox(value = total, icon = "fas fa-cubes")
})
```

## Row

###

```{r}
my_plot <- ggplot(remote_data, aes(x = Category, y = Count)) +
  geom_col(aes(text = Count)) +
  theme_minimal()

# Put ggplotly() inside renderPlotly({})
renderPlotly({
  ggplotly(my_plot, tooltip = "text")
})
```
